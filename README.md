# Subject ft_services
The project consists of setting up an infrastructure of different services. To do this, you must use Kubernetes. You will need to set up a multi-service cluster. Each service will have to run in a dedicated container. Each container must bear the same name as the service concerned and for performance reasons, containers have to be build using Alpine Linux. Also, they will need to have a Dockerfile written by you which is called in the setup.sh. You will have to build yoursel the images that you will use. It is forbidden to take already build images or use services like DockerHub.
